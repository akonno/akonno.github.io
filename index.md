# Akihisa Konno (金野 祥久)

University educator & researcher in mechanical engineering.
I develop lightweight, reproducible open-source tools for research and education.

## Selected open-source tools

A small collection of open-source tools developed to support
research workflows, scientific visualization, and engineering education.

- **[drawstuff-modern](https://github.com/akonno/drawstuff-modern)** — an open-source OpenGL visualization library for modern replacements of ODE drawstuff
- **[RectPlacer](https://akonno.github.io/RectPlacer)** — an open-source web tool for defining axis-aligned cuboid regions on STL models for numerical analysis preprocessing
- **[Hanoi Simulator](https://akonno.github.io/hanoisimulator/)** — an open-source web app for teaching recursion concepts
- **[FluidSeminarMaterials](https://akonno.github.io/FluidSeminarMaterials/)** — open teaching materials and exercises for a fluid engineering seminar (Japanese)

## Small tools

Small, focused utilities developed to solve specific practical problems.

- **[Clock & Timer](https://akonno.github.io/clock-timer/)** — a presentation-friendly clock and timer designed with visual comfort in mind
